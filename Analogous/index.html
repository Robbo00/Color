        <div class="cont">
            Monochromatic color schemes are built around the use of a single hue, which serves as the primary color throughout the design. This approach involves creating different shades, tints, and tones of that base color to add depth, contrast, and variety without introducing any other colors. A shade is created by adding black to the original color, darkening it. A tint is made by adding white, lightening the color, while a tone is achieved by adding gray, which adjusts the intensity or saturation of the color.
            
            The result is a cohesive, harmonious palette where all the variations of the single color work together seamlessly. This technique can be used to evoke a sense of calm, balance, and sophistication in a design, as it maintains visual unity and avoids the complexity of clashing hues. Monochromatic color schemes are often used in minimalist or modern design, as they can help emphasize form, texture, and layout without the distraction of multiple colors. </div>

                <div class="cont">A monochromatic color scheme is often used when someone wants a calm and cohesive look in a design. It's ideal for creating a sense of simplicity and elegance, as it avoids visual clutter. This approach works well in spaces or designs where the focus is on texture, form, or subtle variations rather than contrasting colors.</div>
